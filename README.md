My first project using the free open source community for full stack web development. The Odin Project

During this journey I've learned the importance of using commit messages when pushing out project changes. I've learned how to write HTML, including images in my pages and the different types of links that can be used. 

Some key highlights is my ability to now use Linux based systems and navigate using the terminal. 

This project will highlight all of the things I've learned so far and also be the first project i've completed for The Odin Project. My goal is to prove that anyone can learn full stack development as long as they put in the time to apply themselves. This project will be the start of many projects to come. I am excited to finally dedicate my time to a journey I so easily quit several times.
